This project aims to provide a SQL parser, relational query planner, and query execution in the Rust programming language.

The goal is to be able work with any data source by implementing some traits for that data source.

This is a personal research project and is in a very early stage of development.

This project is very much inspired by Apache Calcite although the design of the relational plan and related optimizations is closer to Apache Spark.
