CuckooDB - because building your own database is crazy!

This is a personal research project where I get to experiment with database internals in the Rust programming language.

At this time, I have no plans to turn this into an actual product, since the world has enough database products already, but I do expect to produce a fully working SQL database (with extremely limited functionality).
